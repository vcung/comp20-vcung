<h1>Introduction</h1>
   <p>Scorecenter is a server-side web application that maintains high scores for HTML5 games using 
   Heroku, Node.js with the Express web framework, and MongoDB.</p>
   
   <p>We have been hired to evaluate and resolve potential security issues in the Scorecenter application
   that would undermine the integrity of the product.</p>
   
   
<h1>Methodology</h1> 
   <p>The Scorecenter site is located at <a href ="http://murmuring-escarpment-6685.herokuapp.com/">http://murmuring-escarpment-6685.herokuapp.com</a></p>
   <p>The vulnerabilities of the application was primarily tested with OWASP Web Scarab,
   a program that aids in web application security assessment by allowing
   the interception and modification of all server-client HTTP and HTTPS data.</p>
<div>
<h1>Abstract of Findings</h1>
<p>Not everything from assignment 5 was implemented, so there were no opportunity for black-box testing.
The only opportunity for client communication with the program is at the /submit.json page, which is the source of the security problems.
Because there are no input validation in /submit.json, it inserts everything in the POST request it receives. Not only does this can 
waste space in the database with potential useless entries, the front page is also affected since it shows all content stored in the database.
Unwanted messages and inappropriate entries can also be displayed in the front page. </p>
</div>

<h1>Issues Found</h1>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<h2>No Server-side Validation</h2>
<h3>Location</h3>
<p>submit.json - found sending POST request using OWASP</p>
<h3>Severity</h3><p class = "severity">High</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>User can send in values of any length and can include nonsense numbers and symbols to the database.
User can include in their POST any parameter and value because the entire body is inserted into
the database, rather than specifying and only inserting the desired parameters.
As a result, the user can also control what nonsense shows up in the front page as all content 
stored in the database is displayed as a JSON string. So something like <a href="front.html">this</a> can happen.
Script tags can be included in the input, however code will not execute, so the application is safe is that regard.</p>
<h3>Resolution</h3>
<p>Sanitize input to contain desired characters. Inappropriate paramenters and values should be rejected and error
messages should be displayed to notify user of validation errors and failure to POST. That way, the front page would only
display parameters relevant to a Scorecenter.
</p>
</td><td>
<h2>No Validation in Display of Database Entries</h2>
<h3>Location</h3>
<p>homepage - found testing the security of submit.json</p>
<h3>Severity</h3><p class = "severity">Medium</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The front page displays all the entries in the database, which lacks input validation. Therefore, inappropriate
content can end up on the front page. </p>
<h3>Resolution</h3>
<p>Instead of barfing out everything in the database with the lines:
<code> collection.find().toArray(function(err, docs) {res.send(docs);});</code>, the <code>docs</code> should be parsed
so that the desired and known content can be explicitly specified.
That way, inappropriate parameters inserted into the database from submit.json would at least be ignored.
However, the values of the parameters may not be appropriate, but that can be resolved with sanitation 
of input in submit.json.
</p>
</td><td>
<h2>Bad Programming Practice</h2>
<h3>Location</h3>
<p>Source Code - web.js - Found analyzing source code</p>
<h3>Severity</h3><p class = "severity">Low</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>There are many commented out lines of code throughout web.js as well as functions that will not execute, such as
the <code>formatToHTML</code> function does not. This is not a security issue, but clean, readable code makes it easier find and notice bugs and security issues.
I guess this can also hinder attackers trying to understand and take advantage of the source code.</p>
<h3>Resolution</h3>
<p>Remove commented code and code that will not execute (the <code>formatToHTML</code> function).</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>
There are a couple of security issues in the Scorecenter web application that allow others to add data without restriction to the database
as well as to the display of the frontpage. Fortunately, Scorecenter is not at risk attackers to manipulate information or the layout. 

After sanitization of input, Scorecenter should be relatively safe.
