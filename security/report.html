<h1>Introduction</h1>
   <p>Scorecenter is a server-side web application that maintains high scores for HTML5 games using 
   Heroku, Node.js with the Express web framework, and MongoDB.</p>
   
   <p>We have been hired to evaluate and resolve potential security issues in the Scorecenter application
   that would undermine the integrity of the product.</p>
   
   
<h1>Methodology</h1> - Describe your methodology pen testing the application, including the tools that you used
   <p>The Scorecenter site is located at </p>
   <p>The vulnerabilities of the application was primarily tested with Paros,
   a program that aids in web application security assessment by allowing
   the interception and modification of all server-client HTTP and HTTPS data</p>
<div>
<h1>Abstract of Findings</h1>Provide an overview of all the security issues you identified. This section should be written for non-technical managers who do not have technical expertise and do not have time to read the entire document. Write this section using lay language.
<p>Not everything from assignment 5 was implemented. There were no opportunity for black-box testing.
The only opportunity for client communication with the program 
is at the /submit.json page.</p>

<h1>Issues Found</h1> - For each issue that you find, document:
Issue (e.g., database injection, really bad programming practice)
<h2>No Server-side Validation</h2>
<h3>Location</h3>
<p>submit.json</p>
<h3>Severity</h3><p class = "severity">HIGH</p>
<h3>Description</h3><p>- found sending POST request using OWASP</p>
<p>User can send in values of any length and can include nonsense numbers and symbols to the database.
User can include in their POST any parameter and value because the entire body is inserted into
the database, rather than specifying and only inserting the desired parameters. 
As a result, the user can also control what nonsense shows up in the front page as all content 
stored in the database is displayed as a JSON string. Script tags can be included in the input, 
however code will not execute, so the application is safe is that regard.</p>
<h3>Resolution</h3>
<p>Sanitize input to contain desired characters. Inappropriate paramenters and values should be rejected and error
messages should be displayed to notify user of validation errors and failure to POST. That way, the front page would only
display parameters relevant to a Scorecenter.
