The switch statement located in station_info.js that hard-codes the name of the station and its 
longitudes and latitudes does not work. I didn't have time to find 
another way to compare strings.
Since I could not get the longitudes and latitudes, I could not display
the location of the stations.
Used some code from examples in github.com/tuftsdev.webprogramming
Approximate time spent: 6 hours
