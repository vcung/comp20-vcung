1. This repository is for Web Programming at Tufts University 
   Department of Computer Science.
   
2. My favorite project is Assignment 5, creating Frogger. I enjoyed implementing
   a game and testing it.

3. I am most proud of Assigment 5 because it embodies many of the concepts I learned
   in web programming, especially after the improvements made to the game, 
   as well as the added high score center.
   
 
4. I feel that I have a good grasp of the basics of web programming after this
   course. I feel that I am well prepared to continue learning how to develop 
   for the web using concepts I learned from this class. I think one of the 
   most important thing I learned in COMP20, is how to read and utilize other people's code.
